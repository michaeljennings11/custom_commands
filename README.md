# Usage
These are custom commands I have created to optimize my workflow.
To easily run these commands from the command line they can be placed in a directory of your choosing, made executable,
and the directory can be added to your PATH environment variable:
```shell
mkdir $HOME/bin
cd $HOME/bin
git clone https://github.com/michaeljennings11/custom_commands.git .
chmod u+x <chosen-command>

export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```
